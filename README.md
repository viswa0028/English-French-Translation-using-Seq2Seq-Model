## Overview
This project implements a Seq2Seq model with an encoder-decoder architecture for translating English sentences into French. The model leverages an LSTM network for both the encoder and the decoder.

## Model Architecture
The model comprises two main components:
- **Encoder**: Processes the input English sentence and converts it into a fixed-size context vector.
- **Decoder**: Takes the context vector from the encoder and generates the corresponding French translation.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch
- TorchText
- NumPy

Install the required packages using:
```sh
pip install torch torchtext numpy
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is a parallel corpus of English-French sentence pairs. You can use the [Multi30k dataset](https://github.com/multi30k/dataset) for this purpose.

## Training
To train the model, execute the following script:
```sh
python train.py --data_path /path/to/dataset --epochs 10 --batch_size 64
```

## Evaluation
Evaluate the model using the test dataset:
```sh
python evaluate.py --data_path /path/to/dataset --model_path /path/to/saved_model
```

## Usage
To translate a sentence from English to French, run the translation script:
```sh
python translate.py --sentence "Hello, how are you?"
```

## Results
The model achieves a BLEU score of XX.XX on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in translating English to French.
